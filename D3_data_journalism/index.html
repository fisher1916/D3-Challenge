          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income</h2>
          <p>The correlations between income and health risks has been widely studied and documented. The average life expectancy in the 
            United States strongly correlates with annual income of individuals. Looking specifically at median income compared to obesity
             rates, there are a few points that stood out. 
          </p>

          <p><strong>1)</strong> The 3 states that had the highest obesity rates, also came in 
            as the bottom 3 for lowest income. Likewise, high median income states tended
            to have very low obesity rates.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2)</strong> The 3 of the top 4 states in highest median income had obesity rates that were in the mid-range compared to 
            other states. This was surprising, and shows there are factors, aside from income, that play a role in obesity rates.</p>
          <p><strong>3)</strong> While there does seem to be a direct correlation between income and obesity, it appears that over approximately
            $60,000, there is a diminished return on how much income affects the overall obesity rate.
